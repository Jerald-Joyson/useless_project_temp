### Project Description

**Tap & Traps** is an app that hilariously pretends to select a random member, but there's a catch: it always picks the second selection. Built using React Native, this app is an exercise in playful coding that brings an amusingly pointless twist to randomization.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Have you ever needed a truly biased random number selector that _always_ picks the 2nd item? No? Well, that‚Äôs exactly the non-issue this project tackles! It‚Äôs perfect for ensuring your selection process is predictably random‚Äîpredictable because it‚Äôs always the same.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We solved this non-existent problem by creating a member selection app that deceives users with the illusion of randomness but lands on the 5th item every time. Why? Because sometimes you just want a guaranteed "random" outcome with zero suspense or surprise.

## Technical Details

### Technologies/Components Used

For Software:

- **Languages used**: JavaScript
- **Frameworks used**: React Native
- **Libraries used**: React Native built-in components, any state management libraries if applicable (e.g., Redux or Context API)
- **Tools used**: Visual Studio Code for development, Expo CLI for running and testing the app, Git for version control

### Implementation

The app was implemented using React Native to build the UI and JavaScript for the core logic. The random number generation is intentionally coded to always return the 2nd item. The app includes components for user interaction, such as buttons and display areas for the result, while React Native's rendering capabilities handle user inputs and visuals.

**Tap & Traps** - Second Click Winner
- This is a simple selection game where:
- Purpose: Randomly select a member/item with a fun interactive twist
- Core Mechanic: The second tap automatically becomes the winner
### How it Works:
- First tap places a red numbered point (#1)
- Second tap places a green numbered point (#2) - this is automatically the winner
- No need for a separate selection button
### Features:
- Visual feedback with red/green colors
- Numbered points for clarity
- Simple reset button to start over
  The app's design makes it impossible to manipulate the outcome since the second tap is always automatically selected, ensuring a fair and random selection process. Perfect for quick decisions or choosing random participants in a group.
